A **recipe sharing platform** with Pinterest-style visual discovery.\n\nLet me confirm what I'm understanding:\n\n**Core Concept:**\n- Users share recipes (with photos)\n- Visual, browsable interface (like Pinterest boards/pins)\n- Discover new recipes from other users\n\n**Key Questions:**\n\n**1. Recipe Features:**\n- Ingredients list?\n- Step-by-step instructions?\n- Cooking time/difficulty?\n- Nutritional information?\n- User ratings/reviews?\n\n**2. Organization:**\n- Can users create collections/boards?\n- Search by ingredient, cuisine, diet type?\n- Tag system?\n\n**3. Social Features:**\n- Follow other users?\n- Like/save recipes?\n- Comments?\n- Share to social media?\n\n**4. User Types:**\n- Just home cooks?\n- Professional chefs too?\n- Anyone can post, or curated?\n\nYour answers will help me create a detailed PRD!",
