Tag-based organization\n  3. Project grouping\n\nBased on this scope, I'd recommend a **Level 4 Greenfield** workflow:\n1. Vision elicitation with Mary (Business Analyst)\n2. PRD creation with John (Product Manager)\n3. Architecture design with Winston (Technical Architect)\n4. Epic and story breakdown with Bob (Scrum Master)\n5. Implementation with Amelia (Software Developer)\n\nThis will take approximately 2-4 months for a production-ready MVP.\n\nWould you like me to start with the vision elicitation session?",
