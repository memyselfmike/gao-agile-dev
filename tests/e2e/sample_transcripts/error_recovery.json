Vision elicitation (understand your requirements)\n2. PRD creation (document features)\n3. Architecture design\n4. Implementation planning\n```\nJust tell me about your todo app idea!\n\n**Option 2: Work on Existing Project**\nIf you have an existing todo app:\n```\nNavigate to your project directory first:\ncd /path/to/your/todo-app\n```\nThen I can analyze it and create documentation.\n\n**Option 3: Quick PRD (Not Recommended)**\nI can create a generic todo app PRD, but it won't be tailored to your specific needs.\n\nWhich option works best for you?",

Key Collaboration Features:**\nWhich features are most important?\n- Task assignment to team members?\n- Real-time updates?\n- Comments/discussions on tasks?\n- File attachments?\n- Notifications?\n- Team workspaces/projects?\n\n**3. Platform:**\n- Web app?\n- Mobile app?\n- Desktop app?\n- All platforms?\n\nTake your time - these answers will shape the entire project!",
