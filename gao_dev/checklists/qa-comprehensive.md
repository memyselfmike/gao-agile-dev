# GAO-Dev Quality Assurance Checklist

## Code Quality

### Clean Architecture
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Dependencies point inward
- [ ] Business logic isolated from framework code
- [ ] Core services are framework-agnostic

### SOLID Principles
- [ ] Single Responsibility: Each class/module has one reason to change
- [ ] Open/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- [ ] Liskov Substitution: Subtypes are substitutable for their base types
- [ ] Interface Segregation: No client forced to depend on unused methods
- [ ] Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Type Safety
- [ ] 100% type hints on all functions and methods
- [ ] mypy validation passes with no errors
- [ ] Return types specified
- [ ] Parameter types specified
- [ ] No use of `Any` unless absolutely necessary

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- [ ] 80%+ code coverage achieved
- [ ] All critical paths tested
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error handling tested

### Test Types
- [ ] Unit tests for business logic
- [ ] Integration tests for service interactions
- [ ] End-to-end tests for workflows
- [ ] Tests are fast and reliable

## Documentation

- [ ] All public functions have docstrings
- [ ] Complex logic explained with comments
- [ ] README is up-to-date
- [ ] API documentation complete

## Git & Deployment

- [ ] Conventional commit messages
- [ ] Feature branches used
- [ ] No secrets in code
- [ ] Dependencies documented

## Error Handling

- [ ] All exceptions caught and handled
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Errors logged appropriately
- [ ] Recovery mechanisms in place

## Logging

- [ ] Structured logging used
- [ ] Appropriate log levels
