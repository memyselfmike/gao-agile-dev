  - "API versioning strategy? (URL versioning, header versioning)"
  - "Documentation approach? (OpenAPI/Swagger, GraphQL introspection)"

authentication:
  - "Authentication method? (JWT, OAuth 2.0, API keys, Basic Auth)"
  - "Token expiration and refresh strategy?"
  - "Rate limiting per user/client?"
  - "Scope-based or role-based permissions?"
  - "Third-party authentication providers?"

endpoints:
  - "What are the main entities/resources to expose?"
  - "CRUD operations for all entities or custom endpoints?"
  - "Pagination strategy? (offset/limit, cursor-based)"
  - "Filtering and search capabilities needed?"
  - "Sorting and ordering options?"
  - "Bulk operations support? (batch create/update/delete)"

data_model:
  - "Database type? (SQL: PostgreSQL/MySQL, NoSQL: MongoDB/DynamoDB)"
  - "Relationships between entities?"
