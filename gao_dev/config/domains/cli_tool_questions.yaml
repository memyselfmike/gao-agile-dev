general:

  - "Operating systems to support? (Linux, macOS, Windows)"
  - "Installation method? (pip, npm, brew, cargo, binary download)"

commands:
  - "What are the main commands or operations?"
  - "Command structure? (flat commands vs. nested subcommands)"
  - "Required vs. optional arguments?"
  - "Flag/option naming conventions? (short: -v, long: --verbose)"
  - "Command chaining or piping support?"
  - "Interactive mode needed? (prompts, wizards)"

configuration:
  - "Configuration file support? (YAML, JSON, TOML, INI)"
  - "Where to store config? (~/.config, project-local, both)"
  - "Environment variable support?"
  - "Config file auto-generation or init command?"
  - "Multiple configuration profiles?"
  - "Secrets management? (API keys, tokens)"

input_output:
  - "Input sources? (files, stdin, API, database)"
  - "Output formats? (plain text, JSON, YAML, table)"
  - "Output format customization? (--format flag)"
  - "Colored output or styling?"
  - "Progress indicators for long operations?"
  - "Verbose and debug modes?"
  - "Quiet mode to suppress output?"

features:
  - "File operations? (read, write, watch, glob patterns)"
  - "Network operations? (HTTP requests, API calls)"
  - "Database connectivity?"
  - "Shell command execution?"
  - "Daemon or background process mode?"
  - "Scheduled tasks or cron integration?"
  - "Plugin or extension system?"

error_handling:
  - "Error message style? (friendly, technical, both)"
  - "Exit codes for different error types?"
  - "Retry logic for transient failures?"
  - "Logging to file or syslog?"
  - "Stack traces in debug mode?"

user_experience:
  - "Help text and documentation style?"
  - "Auto-completion support? (bash, zsh, fish)"
  - "Man pages or --help output?"
  - "Examples in help text?"
  - "Confirmation prompts for destructive operations?"
  - "Dry-run or preview mode?"
  - "Interactive configuration wizard?"

performance:
  - "Performance requirements? (startup time, operation speed)"
  - "Large file handling? (streaming, chunking)"
  - "Parallel processing or concurrency?"
  - "Memory usage constraints?"
  - "Caching to speed up repeated operations?"

distribution:
  - "Package managers to support? (apt, yum, brew, chocolatey, winget)"
  - "Binary releases for each platform?"
  - "Auto-update mechanism?"
  - "Version checking?"
  - "Telemetry or usage analytics? (opt-in)"

testing:
  - "Unit test coverage goals?"
  - "Integration tests with real files/APIs?"
  - "Cross-platform testing needs?"
  - "End-to-end CLI tests?"

technical:
  - "CLI framework? (Click, Typer for Python; Commander for Node; Cobra for Go)"
  - "Argument parsing library?"
  - "Configuration library?"
  - "HTTP client library?"
  - "Testing framework?"

focus_discovery:
  - "Which area needs most clarity: command structure, configuration, I/O, features, UX, or distribution?"
  - "Are there specific workflows or use cases to explore in depth?"
