Scale Levels (BMAD Method - Scale-Adaptive Agile):

- Level 0 (< 1 hour): Single atomic change - bug fix, config tweak, documentation update

- Level 1 (1-4 hours, 1-3 stories): Tiny focused feature in existing, established system
  Example: Adding password strength indicator to existing login form

- Level 2 (1-2 weeks, 3-8 stories, 1 epic): Small feature addition to existing system
  Example: Adding email notifications to existing todo app, implementing dark mode
  Key distinction: Architecture and infrastructure already exist

- Level 3 (1-2 months, 12-40 stories, 2-5 epics): Significant enhancement to existing system
  Example: Adding multi-tenant support to existing SaaS, building analytics dashboard
  Key distinction: Requires architectural decisions for new components

- Level 4 (2-6 months, 40+ stories, 5+ epics): Complete application built from scratch (greenfield)
  Examples: Building a todo app, creating a blog platform, making a chat system
  Key distinction: Starting from zero - requires foundation work, architecture decisions,
  infrastructure setup. Even "simple" greenfield apps need 40+ stories when properly broken
  down into user stories covering: authentication, core features, infrastructure, quality,
  and polish.

Philosophical Note:
The fundamental distinction is greenfield vs brownfield. Building from scratch (greenfield)
is qualitatively different from enhancing existing code (brownfield), regardless of
perceived complexity. Greenfield requires foundational decisions that compound over the
project lifetime, while brownfield builds on proven architecture and existing infrastructure.
