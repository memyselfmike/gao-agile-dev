Scale Levels (BMAD Method):
- Level 0: Single atomic change (< 1 hour) - bug fix, small tweak, chore
- Level 1: Bug fix or tiny feature (1-4 hours, 1-3 stories) - single focused fix/feature in existing code
- Level 2: Small feature addition (1-2 weeks, 3-8 stories, 1 epic) - adding feature to existing system
- Level 3: Medium feature set (1-2 months, 12-40 stories, 2-5 epics) - significant enhancement to existing system
- Level 4: Greenfield application (2-6 months, 40+ stories, 5+ epics) - building complete app from scratch

CRITICAL: Greenfield projects (building from scratch) should ALWAYS be Level 4, regardless of perceived "simplicity".
Even a "simple todo app" built from scratch requires: architecture, database design, API design, authentication,
testing infrastructure, deployment, documentation - this is Level 4 work.
