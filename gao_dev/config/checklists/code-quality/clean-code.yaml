  items:
    - id: "dry-principle"
      text: "Code follows DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)"
      severity: "high"
      help_text: "Extract common logic into functions or classes. Avoid copy-paste code. Use inheritance or composition to share behavior."

    - id: "meaningful-names"
      text: "Variables, functions, and classes have meaningful, descriptive names"
      severity: "high"
      help_text: "Names should reveal intent. Avoid abbreviations. Use searchable names. Boolean variables should be questions (is_active, has_permission)."

    - id: "small-functions"
      text: "Functions are small and focused (<50 lines)"
      severity: "medium"
      help_text: "Functions should do one thing well. Extract complex logic into helper functions. Use early returns to reduce nesting."

    - id: "function-arguments"
      text: "Functions have a reasonable number of arguments (<5)"
      severity: "medium"
      help_text: "Too many arguments indicate the function is doing too much. Consider using a configuration object or data class."

    - id: "error-handling"
      text: "Error handling is explicit and informative"
      severity: "high"
      help_text: "Use specific exceptions, not generic Exception. Provide context in error messages. Don't swallow exceptions silently."

    - id: "comments-why-not-what"
      text: "Comments explain 'why', not 'what' (code should be self-explanatory)"
      severity: "low"
      help_text: "Good code is self-documenting. Comments should explain business logic, gotchas, or non-obvious decisions."

    - id: "no-magic-numbers"
      text: "No magic numbers or strings; use named constants"
      severity: "medium"
      help_text: "Replace literal values with named constants. Use enums for related constants."

    - id: "consistent-style"
      text: "Code follows consistent style and formatting"
      severity: "low"
      help_text: "Use Black for Python formatting. Follow PEP 8. Be consistent with naming conventions."
