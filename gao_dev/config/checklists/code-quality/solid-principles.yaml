      severity: "high"
      help_text: "A class should have only one reason to change. If a class does multiple things, split it into separate classes."

    - id: "open-closed"
      text: "Classes are open for extension but closed for modification"
      severity: "medium"
      help_text: "Use inheritance, composition, or interfaces to extend behavior without modifying existing code."

    - id: "liskov-substitution"
      text: "Subtypes can be substituted for their base types without breaking functionality"
      severity: "high"
      help_text: "Child classes should honor the contract of parent classes. Don't override methods in ways that violate expectations."

    - id: "interface-segregation"
      text: "Interfaces are focused and clients are not forced to depend on unused methods"
      severity: "medium"
      help_text: "Split large interfaces into smaller, focused ones. Use Protocol classes in Python for implicit interfaces."

    - id: "dependency-inversion"
      text: "High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules; both depend on abstractions"
      severity: "high"
      help_text: "Depend on interfaces/protocols, not concrete implementations. Use dependency injection for better testability."

    - id: "god-class-check"
      text: "No 'God classes' with too many responsibilities"
      severity: "critical"
      help_text: "Classes should be <300 lines. If a class does everything, refactor into smaller, focused classes."

    - id: "proper-abstractions"
      text: "Abstractions are meaningful and not over-engineered"
      severity: "medium"
      help_text: "Create abstractions when they add value, not for the sake of abstraction. Balance flexibility with simplicity."
