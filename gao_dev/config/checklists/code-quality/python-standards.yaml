  items:
    - id: "pep8-compliance"
      text: "Code follows PEP 8 style guide"
      severity: "medium"
      help_text: "Use Black for formatting. Run flake8 or ruff for linting. Line length should be <100 characters."
      references:
        - "https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/"

    - id: "docstrings"
      text: "All public functions and classes have docstrings"
      severity: "high"
      help_text: "Use Google or NumPy style docstrings. Include Args, Returns, and Raises sections. Document parameters and return types."

    - id: "list-comprehensions"
      text: "Use list comprehensions instead of map/filter where appropriate"
      severity: "low"
      help_text: "List comprehensions are more Pythonic and often more readable. But don't sacrifice readability for brevity."

    - id: "context-managers"
      text: "Use context managers (with statements) for resource management"
      severity: "high"
      help_text: "Use 'with' for file operations, database connections, locks. Create custom context managers for cleanup logic."

    - id: "exceptions"
      text: "Use Python's exception hierarchy appropriately"
      severity: "medium"
      help_text: "Catch specific exceptions, not bare 'except'. Create custom exceptions for domain logic. Use exception chaining."

    - id: "iterators-generators"
      text: "Use iterators and generators for memory efficiency"
      severity: "low"
      help_text: "Use generators (yield) for large datasets. Prefer itertools over manual loops where appropriate."

    - id: "dataclasses"
      text: "Use dataclasses or attrs for simple data containers"
      severity: "medium"
      help_text: "Prefer dataclasses over manual __init__ and __repr__. Use frozen=True for immutable data."

    - id: "imports"
      text: "Imports are organized (stdlib, third-party, local) and clean"
      severity: "low"
      help_text: "Use isort to organize imports. No unused imports. No wildcard imports (from x import *)."
