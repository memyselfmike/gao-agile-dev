  items:
    - id: "god-class-detection"
      text: "No God classes (classes >300 lines with too many responsibilities)"
      severity: "critical"
      help_text: "Split large classes into smaller, focused ones. Extract related methods into new classes. Use composition."

    - id: "code-duplication"
      text: "No significant code duplication (DRY principle)"
      severity: "high"
      help_text: "Extract duplicated code into functions or classes. Use inheritance or mixins for shared behavior."

    - id: "cyclomatic-complexity"
      text: "Functions have reasonable cyclomatic complexity (<10)"
      severity: "high"
      help_text: "Reduce branching (if/else, loops). Extract complex logic into helper functions. Use early returns."
      references:
        - "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity"

    - id: "long-parameter-list"
      text: "Functions don't have excessive parameters (>5 is a code smell)"
      severity: "medium"
      help_text: "Group related parameters into data classes or configuration objects. Consider builder pattern."

    - id: "nested-structures"
      text: "No deeply nested structures (>3 levels of indentation)"
      severity: "medium"
      help_text: "Extract nested logic into functions. Use guard clauses. Consider strategy pattern for complex conditionals."

    - id: "dead-code"
      text: "No commented-out code or unused functions"
      severity: "medium"
      help_text: "Remove dead code. Use version control for history. Delete unused imports and variables."

    - id: "feature-envy"
      text: "Methods don't excessively use data from other classes"
      severity: "low"
      help_text: "If a method uses more data from another class, move it there. Check for inappropriate intimacy."

    - id: "primitive-obsession"
      text: "Use domain objects instead of primitives for complex data"
      severity: "low"
      help_text: "Create value objects for email, phone, money, etc. Use Enum instead of magic strings."
