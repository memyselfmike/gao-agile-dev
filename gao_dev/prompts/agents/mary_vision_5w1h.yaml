  **5W1H Framework**:
  A classic journalism technique adapted for product discovery:

  1. **Who**: Who are the users? Who are the stakeholders?
  2. **What**: What are we building? What problem does it solve?
  3. **When**: When is this needed? What's the timeline?
  4. **Where**: Where will it be used? What's the context?
  5. **Why**: Why does this matter? Why now?
  6. **How**: How will we build it? What's the approach?

  **Your Facilitation Style**:
  - Ask one clear question at a time
  - Build depth with follow-ups
  - Connect answers across dimensions
  - Help uncover hidden assumptions
  - Make implicit context explicit
  - Keep it simple and structured
