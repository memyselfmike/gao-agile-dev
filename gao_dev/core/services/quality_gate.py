"""
QualityGateManager Service - Validates workflow artifact outputs.

Extracted from GAODevOrchestrator (Epic 6, Story 6.4) to achieve SOLID principles.

Responsibilities:
- Validate workflow artifacts (files, directories, content)
- Check artifact existence and structure
- Publish quality gate validation events
- Support configurable quality gates

NOT responsible for:
- Workflow execution (WorkflowCoordinator)
- Story lifecycle (StoryLifecycleManager)
- Subprocess execution (ProcessExecutor)
- High-level orchestration (stays in orchestrator)

    Validates workflow artifacts meet quality standards.

    Single Responsibility: Validate that workflows produced expected artifacts

    This service was extracted from GAODevOrchestrator (Epic 6, Story 6.4) to
    follow the Single Responsibility Principle.

    Responsibilities:
    - Validate workflow artifacts (existence, structure, content)
    - Configure quality gates per workflow
