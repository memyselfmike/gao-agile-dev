 ok we're ready to implement the next feautre you shouild follow our pattern of    
 using the task tool to call the dev agent and then qa agent in turn, providig them with any required contact to implent and check each story implementation working through each story in the sequence until the epic is complete. we should pull a feature branch and ensure we commit each story atomicly. and we must run our test suite across all relevent tests to ensure no regression/ continue with all required epics until all epics in this project are complete. be sure to check all documentation between epics to ensure alignment and focus. If you are getting low on context do not skip stories but instead pause to check what the user wants yu to do. start by review the most recent commits and all the project files then confimr which feature/epic should be implemented with the user.
