# Story 3.3: Implement Repository Pattern for Persistence

**Epic**: Epic 3 - Design Pattern Implementation
**Story Points**: 5
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
**Status**: Draft

---

## User Story

**As a** core developer
**I want** data access logic abstracted through the Repository Pattern
**So that** business logic is separated from I/O operations and storage can be easily swapped

---

## Description

Implement lightweight Repository Pattern for GAO-Dev's file-based persistence. Since GAO-Dev primarily uses file I/O rather than databases, this creates a thin abstraction over file operations to separate business logic from storage concerns.

**Current State**: File I/O operations scattered throughout codebase, tight coupling to Path operations.

**Target State**: Repository classes in `gao_dev/core/repositories/` that abstract file persistence.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Repository

- [ ] **Interface created**: `IRepository` already exists in `gao_dev/core/interfaces/repository.py`
- [ ] **Base class**: `FileRepository` base implementation for file-based storage
- [ ] **CRUD operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete, List, Exists

### Concrete Repositories

- [ ] **StateRepository**: For project state files (.gao-state.yaml)
- [ ] **WorkflowRepository**: For workflow metadata
- [ ] **ConfigRepository**: For configuration files

### Integration

- [ ] SandboxManager uses repositories instead of direct Path operations
- [ ] StateManager uses StateRepository
- [ ] Backward compatible - no breaking changes

### Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for each repository (80%+ coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] All existing tests pass

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] File repositories implemented
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] Business logic separated from I/O
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] Merged to feature branch
