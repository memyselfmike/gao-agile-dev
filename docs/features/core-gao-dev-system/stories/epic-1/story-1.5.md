# Story 1.5: Set Up Testing Infrastructure

**Epic**: Epic 1 - Foundation
**Story Points**: 5
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Status**: Done

---

## User Story

**As a** core developer
**I want** comprehensive testing infrastructure with mocks and fixtures
**So that** we can test components in isolation and ensure quality

---

## Description

Create complete testing infrastructure including mock implementations of all interfaces, test fixtures, and testing utilities. This infrastructure will be used throughout the refactoring to ensure we don't break existing functionality.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Mock Implementations

- [x] **MockAgent** implements IAgent (for testing)
- [x] **MockWorkflow** implements IWorkflow (for testing)
- [x] **MockRepository** implements IRepository[T] (for testing)
- [x] **MockEventBus** implements IEventBus (for testing)
- [x] **MockMethodology** implements IMethodology (for testing)

### Test Fixtures

- [x] **Sample projects** fixture (temporary test projects)
- [x] **Sample stories** fixture (test story data)
- [x] **Sample workflows** fixture (test workflow definitions)
- [x] **Agent contexts** fixture (test execution contexts)

### Testing Utilities

- [x] **Assertion helpers** for async operations
- [x] **File system helpers** for temporary directories
- [x] **Comparison utilities** for complex objects

### pytest Configuration

- [x] pytest.ini configured with coverage settings
- [x] pytest-asyncio configured
- [x] pytest-cov configured (80% minimum)
- [x] Test discovery patterns set up

## Dependencies

- Story 1.1: Define Core Interfaces (need interfaces to mock)

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Mock implementations work correctly
- [x] Fixtures available for use in tests
- [x] Documentation on how to use test infrastructure
- [x] Example tests using mocks/fixtures
