### Implementation Approach

**Step 1: Define Architectural Principles**
- Clean Architecture / Separation of concerns
- API-first design
- Mobile-responsive from day 1
- Accessibility built-in
- Test-driven development

**Step 2: Design System Components**
- Presentation layer (Next.js pages, components)
- Application layer (API routes, business logic)
- Data layer (database, ORM)
- Cross-cutting (auth, logging, error handling)

**Step 3: Specify Technology Choices**
- Frontend: Next.js 14+, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Next.js API routes (recommended) or FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Auth: NextAuth.js
- Testing: Jest, Playwright, Vitest

**Step 4: Design Database Schema**
- Tables: Users, Todos, Categories, Tags, TodoTags
- Relationships and foreign keys
- Indexes for common queries
- Migration strategy

**Step 5: Define Deployment Strategy**
- Docker Compose for local development
- Docker for production deployment
- Environment-based configuration
- Database migration on startup

## Notes

### Architectural Principles

**Clean Architecture**:
- Separation of concerns
- Dependency inversion
- Business logic independent of frameworks
- Testable components

**API-First Design**:
- Well-defined API contracts
- Versioned APIs
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- RESTful conventions

**Security by Design**:
- Defense in depth
- Least privilege
- Secure by default
- OWASP best practices

**Performance First**:
- Fast page loads (<2s)
- Optimized queries
- Efficient data structures
- Progressive enhancement

### Technology Decisions

**Next.js App Router**:
- Server components for performance
- Built-in API routes
- File-based routing
- Image optimization
- TypeScript support

**PostgreSQL**:
- ACID compliance
- Rich data types
- Full-text search
- Mature ecosystem
- Excellent performance

**Prisma ORM**:
- Type-safe database access
- Automatic migrations
- Excellent TypeScript integration
- Query optimization
- Schema management

**NextAuth.js**:
- Battle-tested authentication
- Multiple providers support
- Session management
- CSRF protection
- Easy integration with Next.js

### Key Design Decisions

**Monorepo vs Separate Repos**:
- Decision: Monorepo (simpler for benchmark)
- Frontend and backend in same repo
- Shared types between frontend/backend

**API Routes vs FastAPI**:
- Decision: Next.js API routes (recommended)
- Simpler deployment
- Single language (TypeScript)
- Better integration with frontend
- FastAPI alternative documented for flexibility

**State Management**:
- Decision: React Context + hooks
- No need for Redux/Zustand at this scale
- Simpler mental model
- Less boilerplate

**CSS Framework**:
- Decision: Tailwind CSS
- Rapid development
- Consistent design
- Small bundle size
- Good accessibility support
