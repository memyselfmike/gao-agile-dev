## User Story

**As a** GAO-Dev system executing a benchmark  
**I want** to initialize a git repository at the start of each sandbox project  
**So that** I can track progress with commits and maintain version history throughout development

- Initial commit created with project structure
- .gitignore file created with appropriate exclusions
- Repository configured with user.name and user.email

### AC2: GitManager Integration

- Methods: init_repo(), create_commit(), get_status()
- Integration with SandboxManager
- Proper error handling for git operations

### AC3: Initial Project Structure Commit
- First commit includes: README.md, .gitignore, package.json
- Commit message follows conventional format
- Commit author set to "GAO-Dev Benchmark"
- Timestamp recorded in metrics

### AC4: Git Integration in BenchmarkRunner
- BenchmarkRunner._initialize_sandbox() calls git init
- Initial commit created before workflow execution
- Git status checked and validated
- Errors logged and reported
