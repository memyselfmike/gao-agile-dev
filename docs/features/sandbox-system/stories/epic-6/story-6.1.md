```

### Implementation Approach

**Step 1: Research Reference Todo Apps**
- Review industry-standard todo applications (Todoist, Any.do, Microsoft To Do)
- Identify must-have features
- Determine scope appropriate for benchmark

**Step 2: Define Feature Set**
- Core features that demonstrate autonomy
- Appropriate complexity (not too simple, not too complex)
- Features that exercise all BMAD phases

**Step 3: Specify Technical Stack**
- Frontend: Next.js 14+ (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- Backend: FastAPI (Python) or Express (Node.js)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Auth: NextAuth.js or similar
- Testing: Jest, Pytest, Playwright

**Step 4: Document Non-Functional Requirements**
- Performance: Page load <2s, API response <200ms
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Security: OWASP top 10 protections
- Browser support: Latest 2 versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

**Step 5: Create User Stories**
- Write detailed user stories for each feature
- Include acceptance criteria
- Prioritize by P0/P1/P2

## Deliverable

**File**: `docs/features/sandbox-system/stories/epic-6/TODO_APP_PRD.md`

**Contents**:
- Complete PRD following the structure above
- 15-25 pages of comprehensive requirements
- Ready for autonomous implementation by GAO-Dev

---

## Dependencies

### Required Knowledge
- Understanding of modern web application patterns
- Full-stack development best practices
- Benchmark requirements from main sandbox PRD

### Related Documents
- `docs/features/sandbox-system/PRD.md` - Main sandbox system PRD
- `docs/features/sandbox-system/ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] PRD document created at `docs/features/sandbox-system/stories/epic-6/TODO_APP_PRD.md`
- [ ] All sections completed with detailed content
- [ ] User stories include testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Technical stack fully specified
- [ ] Success metrics are quantifiable
- [ ] Reviewed by Winston (Architect) for technical feasibility
- [ ] Committed to git with atomic commit

---

## Testing Approach

### Validation Checklist

**Completeness**:
- [ ] All sections present and filled out
- [ ] No TBD or TODO placeholders
- [ ] Sufficient detail for autonomous implementation

**Clarity**:
- [ ] Requirements are unambiguous
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are testable
- [ ] Technical specs are specific

**Feasibility**:
- [ ] Can be built by GAO-Dev autonomously
- [ ] Scope is appropriate for benchmark (not too large)
- [ ] All dependencies are available

**Alignment**:
- [ ] Aligns with sandbox system requirements
- [ ] Supports all metric categories (performance, autonomy, quality)
- [ ] Enables validation of GAO-Dev capabilities

## Related Stories

**Depends On**: None
**Blocks**:
- Story 6.2 (Todo App Architecture) - needs PRD for architectural decisions
- Story 6.3-6.10 (All feature specs) - reference PRD for detailed requirements

## Notes

### Scope Guidelines

**Appropriate Complexity**:
- Should take 30-60 minutes for GAO-Dev to build (autonomous)
- Exercises all BMAD phases (Analysis, Planning, Solutioning, Implementation)
- Demonstrates quality code generation (tests, types, documentation)
- Realistic enough to be production-representative

**Feature Balance**:
- Core features (auth, CRUD) are P0
- Enhanced features (filters, search) are P1
- Advanced features (collaboration, attachments) are P2 (future)

**Benchmark Considerations**:
- Must have clear success criteria (tests passing, coverage, no errors)
- Should collect meaningful metrics across all categories
- Needs to be deterministic (same input -> same output)
- Should support iterative improvement (Epic 7)

### Key Differentiators

This is NOT just any todo app PRD - it's specifically designed to:
1. **Validate Autonomy**: Requirements clear enough for autonomous implementation
2. **Measure Performance**: Features that generate measurable metrics
3. **Demonstrate Quality**: Complexity appropriate for showing code quality
4. **Enable Iteration**: Clear baseline for improvement tracking
