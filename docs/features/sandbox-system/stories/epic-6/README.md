## Deferred Stories (Already Covered)

The following stories were originally planned but are not needed as separate documents since they're comprehensively covered in the existing specifications:

- **Story 6.4**: CRUD Operations Specification → Covered in PRD (user stories) and Architecture (implementation)
- **Story 6.5**: Categories & Tags Specification → Covered in PRD and Architecture
- **Story 6.6**: UI/UX Design → Covered in PRD (wireframes) and Architecture (component hierarchy)
- **Story 6.7**: API Design → Fully documented in Architecture (12+ endpoints)
- **Story 6.8**: Database Schema → Complete schema in Architecture (SQL + Prisma)
- **Story 6.9**: Test Strategy → Covered in Architecture and Auth Specification
- **Story 6.10**: Deployment Configuration → Fully specified in Architecture (Docker, CI/CD)

## Usage for Benchmarking

These specifications serve as the **target requirements** for GAO-Dev benchmark runs:

1. **Input**: Initial prompt + these specification documents
2. **Process**: GAO-Dev builds the application autonomously
3. **Validation**: Compare implementation against specifications
4. **Metrics**: Measure autonomy, quality, performance

### Success Criteria (from PRD):

- All user stories implemented with acceptance criteria met
- >80% test coverage
- 0 TypeScript errors
- 0 linting errors
- API documented (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Deployable with `docker-compose up`

---

## Key Features for Autonomous Implementation

**Authentication (P0)**:
- User registration with validation
- Login with session management
- Logout functionality

**Todo Management (P0)**:
- Create, read, update, delete todos
- Mark todos as complete
- Due dates and priorities
- Rich todo details

**Organization (P0)**:
- Default categories (Work, Personal, Shopping, Health, Other)
- Custom categories
- Tag system with autocomplete
- Filter by category, tag, status

**Enhanced Features (P1)**:
- Search todos by title/description
- Sort by due date, priority, created date
- Bulk operations (complete, delete, change category)

**Quality Requirements (P0)**:
- Full TypeScript (no `any` types)
- Comprehensive tests (>80% coverage)
- API documentation
- Responsive design
- Accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Docker deployment

---

## Technology Stack

**Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
**Backend**: Next.js API Routes (or FastAPI alternative)
**Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ with Prisma ORM
**Authentication**: NextAuth.js
**Testing**: Jest, Playwright, Vitest
**Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose

## Benchmark Metrics

When GAO-Dev builds this application, we measure:

**Performance Metrics**:
- Total build time (target: 30-60 minutes)
- Token usage (target: <500k tokens)
- API cost (target: <$5)

**Autonomy Metrics**:
- Manual interventions (target: 0)
- One-shot success rate (target: >90%)
- Error recovery rate (target: >80%)

**Quality Metrics**:
- Test coverage (target: >80%)
- Type errors (target: 0)
- Linting errors (target: 0)
- Functional completeness (target: 100% of P0 features)
