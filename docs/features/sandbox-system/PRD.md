# Product Requirements Document
## GAO-Dev Sandbox & Benchmarking System

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** John (Product Manager) via GAO-Dev Workflow

---

## Executive Summary

### Vision
Create a deterministic sandbox environment and comprehensive benchmarking system that enables GAO-Dev to validate its autonomous capabilities, measure performance improvements over time, and produce production-ready applications from simple prompts.

### Goals
1. **Validate Full Autonomy**: Prove that GAO-Dev can build complete applications end-to-end without manual intervention
2. **Measure & Improve**: Track key metrics (time, tokens, quality, autonomy) to drive continuous improvement
3. **Establish Baseline**: Create reference implementations that serve as benchmarks for future development
4. **Dogfood Our Process**: Use GAO-Dev to develop GAO-Dev, validating our own BMAD methodology

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State
**Pain Points:**
- No systematic way to test if GAO-Dev can autonomously build a complete application
- Cannot measure performance, quality, or autonomy levels objectively
- No visibility into improvement trends as we add features and refine agents
- Unknown gaps between current capabilities and full autonomy
- Manual, ad-hoc testing that isn't reproducible

**Impact:**
- Cannot confidently claim "autonomous development" without proof
- Don't know which improvements have the biggest impact
- Risk of regression without automated validation
- Slow iteration due to manual testing

### Target State
**Desired End State:**
- Simple prompt → Fully functioning, production-ready application
- Automated benchmarking with clear metrics
- Trend analysis showing improvement over iterations
- Identified and addressed gaps in autonomy
- Reproducible, deterministic testing environment

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Agent Sessions Can't Spawn from Claude Code
- **Impact**: High
- **Probability**: Confirmed
- **Mitigation**: Create standalone execution mode; document manual workflow as alternative

### Risk 2: Boilerplate Repo Not Provided
- **Impact**: High
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Request URL from user; create minimal fallback template

### Risk 3: Benchmark Takes Too Long
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Implement timeouts; start with smaller scope; optimize agent prompts

### Risk 4: Metrics Overhead Impacts Performance
- **Impact**: Low
- **Probability**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Async metric collection; sampling vs. full capture

### Risk 5: Quality Gates Too Strict
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Configurable thresholds; incremental tightening

---

## Open Questions

1. **Boilerplate Repository**: What is the URL and structure of the starter template?
2. **Execution Mode**: Should benchmarks run standalone (CLI) or integrated (within IDE)?
3. **Metric Storage**: SQLite locally or PostgreSQL from the start?
4. **Reporting Frequency**: Real-time dashboards or post-run only?
5. **Multi-Stack Support**: Should we support both FastAPI and Express backends initially?
