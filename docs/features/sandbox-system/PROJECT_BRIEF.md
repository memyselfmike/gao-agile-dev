# GAO-Dev Sandbox & Benchmarking System - Project Brief

## Vision

Create a deterministic sandbox environment and benchmarking system that allows us to:
1. Test GAO-Dev's autonomous capabilities end-to-end
2. Measure and track improvement over iterations
3. Validate full SDLC automation from prompt → production-ready app

## The Problem

Currently, we have no systematic way to:
- Test if GAO-Dev can autonomously build a complete application
- Measure performance (time, tokens, manual intervention needed)
- Track improvement as we add features and refine agents
- Validate that the full BMAD workflow produces production-ready code

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Reference Application: Full-Stack Todo App

**Why Todo App?**
- Industry-standard benchmark
- Covers all key patterns (CRUD, auth, state management)
- Simple enough to complete, complex enough to validate capabilities
- Easy to define "done" criteria

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with React, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI) or Node.js (Express)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Starting Point**: Use existing boilerplate repo (to be provided)

**Features:**
- User authentication
- Create/Read/Update/Delete todos
- Categories/tags
- Due dates and priorities
- Responsive UI
- API documentation
- Tests (unit + integration)
- Docker deployment

### 2. Sandbox Environment

**Requirements:**
- Isolated workspace within `D:\GAO Agile Dev\sandbox\projects\`
- Clean initialization for each benchmark run
- Reproducible setup
- Version-controlled baseline

**Process Flow:**
```
1. User provides: Simple prompt (e.g., "Build a todo app with auth")
2. System executes: Mary → John → Winston → Sally → Bob → Amelia → Murat
3. Output: Production-ready application
```

### 3. Benchmarking & Metrics System

**Metrics to Track:**

**Performance Metrics:**
- Total time (start → finish)
- Time per phase (Analysis, Planning, Solutioning, Implementation)
- Token usage (total + per agent)
- API calls made

**Autonomy Metrics:**
- Manual interventions required
- Prompts needed (initial + follow-ups)
- One-shot success rate (% of tasks completed first try)
- Error recovery rate

**Quality Metrics:**
- Tests written / tests passing
- Code coverage %
- Linting/type errors
- Security vulnerabilities (via automated scans)
- Functional completeness (% of acceptance criteria met)

**Workflow Metrics:**
- Stories created
- Stories completed
- Average story cycle time
- Agent handoffs (successful vs. failed)

**Storage:**
- JSON-based metrics database
- Per-run snapshots
- Aggregate trends over time
- Export to CSV for analysis

### 4. Reporting & Visualization

**Run Report:**
- Summary dashboard (HTML)
- Metrics comparison (current vs. baseline)
- Detailed timeline of agent activities
- Error/warning logs
- Code quality summary

**Trend Analysis:**
- Chart improvement over iterations
- Identify regression points
- Compare different configurations

### 5. Configuration & Repeatability

**Benchmark Configuration File:**
```yaml
benchmark:
  name: "todo-app-baseline"
  description: "Full-stack todo app with auth"
  initial_prompt: "Build a todo application..."

  tech_stack:
    frontend: "nextjs"
    backend: "fastapi"
    database: "postgresql"

  boilerplate_repo: "path/to/starter-template"

  success_criteria:
    - All tests passing
    - Zero type errors
    - API documented
    - Docker deployment working
    - All acceptance criteria met

  metrics_enabled:
    - performance: true
    - autonomy: true
    - quality: true
    - workflow: true
```

## Gaps to Address

**Current System Limitations:**

1. **Agent Coordination**
   - No formal handoff protocol between agents
   - No shared context/memory across agent sessions
   - No retry/recovery mechanisms

2. **Quality Gates**
   - No automated code review before merging
   - No CI/CD integration
   - No automated testing enforcement

3. **Monitoring**
   - No real-time progress tracking
   - No metric collection infrastructure
   - No logging standardization

4. **Boilerplate Integration**
   - No support for cloning starter templates
   - No template variable substitution
   - No project scaffolding automation

5. **Multi-Tech Stack Support**
   - Agents only have Python/Node tools
   - No frontend-specific tooling
   - No database migration support

## Success Criteria

**Phase 1: Baseline (Manual Validation)**
- Can create todo app with heavy manual intervention
- Metrics collected manually
- Identify all gaps

**Phase 2: Semi-Autonomous**
- Agents handle 70%+ of work autonomously
- Automated metrics collection
- <5 manual interventions needed

**Phase 3: Full Autonomy**
- One-shot success: Single prompt → working app
- Zero manual intervention
- All metrics green
- Production-ready output

## Deliverables

1. **Sandbox CLI Commands**
   - `gao-dev sandbox init <project-name>` - Initialize sandbox project
   - `gao-dev sandbox run <benchmark-config>` - Run benchmark
   - `gao-dev sandbox report <run-id>` - Generate report
   - `gao-dev sandbox compare <run1> <run2>` - Compare runs

2. **Benchmark Runner**
   - Automated execution of full workflow
   - Metric collection during execution
   - Progress monitoring

3. **Reference Implementation**
   - Todo app specification
   - Boilerplate integration
   - Test suite definition

4. **Reporting System**
   - HTML dashboard generator
   - Trend analysis charts
   - Export functionality

5. **Documentation**
   - How to create benchmarks
   - How to interpret metrics
   - How to improve scores

## Timeline Estimate

- **Week 1**: Sandbox infrastructure, basic metric collection
- **Week 2**: Reference todo app spec, boilerplate integration
- **Week 3**: Benchmark runner, reporting system
- **Week 4**: First end-to-end run, gap analysis, iteration

## Open Questions

1. What is the boilerplate repo URL/structure?
2. Should we support multiple reference apps (not just todo)?
3. What's the acceptable threshold for "production-ready"?
4. Should metrics be stored locally or in a database?
5. Do we need CI/CD integration for automated benchmarking?

**Next Steps:**
1. Have John (PM) create detailed PRD from this brief
2. Have Winston (Architect) design the system architecture
3. Break down into epics and stories
4. Begin iterative implementation
