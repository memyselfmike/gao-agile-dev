      IMPORTANT: Epic 2 was completed on feature branch but NEVER MERGED TO MAIN.
      All 9 stories were implemented with services extracted, but subsequent Epics 3, 4, 5
      were branched from main BEFORE Epic 2 was merged. Epic 6 will complete this work fresh on main.
      Epic 2 branch kept as reference material.

      CRITICAL: This epic completes the work that should have been Epic 2.
      Epic 2 was completed on a feature branch but never merged to main.
      Epic 6 implements the God Class refactoring fresh on main, using the improved
      foundation from Epics 1, 3, 4, and 5.

      This is REQUIRED before production release.

      Goals:
      - Extract services from orchestrator (1,327 → < 200 lines)
      - Extract services from sandbox manager (781 → < 150 lines)
      - Remove legacy_models.py
      - Achieve complete SOLID compliance
      - Integration testing and validation

notes: |
  ⚠️ IMPORTANT DISCOVERY (2025-10-30):
  Epic 2 was completed on feature branch 'feature/epic-2-god-class-refactoring' but NEVER MERGED TO MAIN.
  All services were extracted on that branch, but Epics 3, 4, 5 proceeded without it.
  See EPIC-2-INVESTIGATION-FINDINGS.md for full details.

  Epic 6 will complete the God Class refactoring fresh on main using the improved foundation.

  ---
  Epic 1 COMPLETED - Foundation laid with interfaces, base classes, and testing infrastructure

  Epic 2 - COMPLETED ON BRANCH, NOT MERGED TO MAIN
  Work was done on 'feature/epic-2-god-class-refactoring' but never integrated.
  Epic 6 will complete this work properly on main.

  Epic 3 COMPLETED - All 5 design patterns implemented and tested (2025-10-29)

  Epic 3 Summary:
  - Story 3.1: Factory Pattern for Agents (AgentFactory, ClaudeAgent, 34 tests)
  - Story 3.2: Strategy Pattern for Workflows (3 strategies, 27 tests)
  - Story 3.3: Repository Pattern (FileRepository, StateRepository, 10 tests)
  - Story 3.4: Observer Pattern (EventBus with pub/sub, 3 tests)
  - Story 3.5: Dependency Injection (demonstrated throughout implementations)
  - Total: 74 tests passing, 26/26 story points complete
  - Coverage: 76-92% across all modules

  Epic 4 COMPLETED - Plugin Architecture fully implemented (2025-10-30)

  Epic 4 Summary:
  - Story 4.1: Plugin Discovery System (PluginDiscovery, PluginMetadata)
