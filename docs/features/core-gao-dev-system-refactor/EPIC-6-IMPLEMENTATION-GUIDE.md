## Before You Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Review Documentation**
   - [ ] Read `LEGACY_CODE_CLEANUP_PLAN.md`
   - [ ] Read `epics.md` Epic 6 section
   - [ ] Review all 10 story files in `stories/epic-6/`
   - [ ] Understand the "why" (Epic 2 was skipped)

2. **Create Regression Test Suite**
   - [ ] **CRITICAL**: Create comprehensive tests BEFORE refactoring
   - [ ] Test current orchestrator behavior
   - [ ] Test current sandbox behavior
   - [ ] Document expected behavior
   - [ ] Establish performance baseline

3. **Set Up Git Workflow**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/epic-6-legacy-cleanup
   ```

4. **Team Alignment**
   - [ ] Review plan with team
   - [ ] Assign stories to developers
   - [ ] Set start date
   - [ ] Schedule daily standups
   - [ ] Schedule code review sessions

## Implementation Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Extract Incrementally**
   - One service at a time
   - Test after each extraction
   - Commit after each story

2. **Test-Driven Refactoring**
   - Write tests that capture current behavior FIRST
   - Extract code
   - Verify tests still pass
   - Add new tests for service

3. **Dependency Injection**
   - All services use constructor DI
   - No direct instantiation inside classes
   - Use factory methods for convenience

4. **Event Publishing**
   - Publish events at key lifecycle points
   - Use existing EventBus
   - Subscribe in tests to verify

5. **Keep It Simple**
   - Services should be < 200 lines
   - Methods should be < 20 lines
   - Single responsibility per service
   - Clear, descriptive names

### Code Review Checklist

After each story:
- [ ] Single responsibility maintained
- [ ] Line count within limits
- [ ] Dependency injection used
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Test coverage 80%+
- [ ] Type hints throughout
- [ ] Docstrings complete
- [ ] No regressions

## Risk Management

### High-Impact Risks

1. **Breaking Existing Functionality**
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive regression tests FIRST
   - **Detection**: Run tests after every change
   - **Response**: Revert and iterate

2. **Service Boundaries Wrong**
   - **Mitigation**: Follow Epic 2 original design
   - **Detection**: Code review, team discussion
   - **Response**: Adjust and re-extract if needed

### Monitoring During Implementation

- Run full test suite after each story
- Check performance benchmarks weekly
- Review code metrics (line counts) daily
- Monitor for memory leaks
- Track velocity (story points/week)

---

## Communication

### Daily Standup Format

Each developer:
1. **Yesterday**: Which story/stories worked on, progress
2. **Today**: Which story working on, blockers
3. **Blockers**: Any impediments

### Weekly Review

Every Friday:
1. Stories completed this week
2. Updated metrics (from `EPIC-6-SPRINT-STATUS.yaml`)
3. Risks encountered
4. Adjustments needed

### End-of-Epic Demo

After Story 6.10:
1. Show before/after metrics
2. Demonstrate refactored architecture
3. Run integration tests live
4. Show performance benchmarks
5. Walk through new service structure
