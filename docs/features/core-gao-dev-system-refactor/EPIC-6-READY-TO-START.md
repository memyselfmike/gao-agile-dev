# Epic 6: Ready to Start

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Status**: ‚úÖ ALL DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE AND ALIGNED WITH REALITY
**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Required for Production)

---

## Investigation Complete ‚úÖ

We investigated the discrepancy between `sprint-status.yaml` (showing Epic 2 complete) and the actual codebase (showing God Classes still exist).

**Finding**: Epic 2 work WAS completed but lives on branch `feature/epic-2-god-class-refactoring` and was **NEVER MERGED TO MAIN**.

**Details**: See `EPIC-2-INVESTIGATION-FINDINGS.md` for complete investigation results.

---

## Documentation Now Accurate ‚úÖ

All documentation has been updated to reflect reality:

### 1. `sprint-status.yaml` ‚úÖ
- Epic 2 marked as "completed_on_branch_not_merged"
- Epic 6 added with all 10 stories

- Notes explain the situation

### 2. `epics.md` ‚úÖ
- Epic 6 added with full details
- 47 story points across 10 stories
- Detailed acceptance criteria
- Background explains why Epic 6 is necessary
- Timeline updated to 13 weeks (+2 buffer)

### 3. Story Files Created ‚úÖ
All 10 story files in `stories/epic-6/`:
- Story 6.1: Extract WorkflowCoordinator (5 pts)
- Story 6.2: Extract StoryLifecycleManager (5 pts)
- Story 6.3: Extract ProcessExecutor (3 pts)
- Story 6.4: Extract QualityGateManager (3 pts)
- Story 6.5: Refactor Orchestrator as Facade (5 pts) - **CRITICAL**

## Current State of Codebase

### Main Branch (What We Have)
- ‚úÖ Epic 1: Foundation (interfaces, models, base classes)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Epic 2: On branch only, NOT merged
- ‚úÖ Epic 3: Design Patterns (Factory, Strategy, Repository, Observer)
- ‚úÖ Epic 4: Plugin Architecture (complete plugin system)
- ‚úÖ Epic 5: Methodology Abstraction (AdaptiveAgile, Simple)
- ‚ùå **God Classes Still Exist**:
  - `orchestrator/orchestrator.py`: **1,327 lines**
  - `sandbox/manager.py`: **781 lines**
  - `core/services/`: **EMPTY**

### What We Need (Epic 6)
- Extract 7 services (4 from orchestrator, 3 from sandbox)
- Refactor orchestrator: 1,327 ‚Üí < 200 lines
- Refactor sandbox manager: 781 ‚Üí < 150 lines
- Remove `legacy_models.py`
- Complete integration testing
- Update all documentation

---

## Why This Approach

### Why Not Merge Epic 2 Branch?

**Reasons**:
1. **Massive merge conflicts** - Epics 3, 4, 5 changed many files
2. **Stale code** - Missing all improvements from Epics 3, 4, 5
3. **Incomplete refactoring** - Orchestrator still 1,269 lines on that branch
4. **Better foundation now** - Main has superior architecture

### Why Epic 6 is Better

**Advantages**:
1. **Clean implementation** - Using current interfaces and patterns
2. **No merge conflicts** - Building on current main
3. **Complete refactoring** - Achieve < 200 lines target
4. **Integrated with plugins** - Works with Epic 4 plugin system
5. **Uses methodology system** - Works with Epic 5 abstractions
6. **Can reference Epic 2** - Learn from that work without being constrained by it

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Impact Risks

1. **Breaking existing functionality**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive regression tests FIRST
   - Detection: Run tests after every change
   - Response: Revert and iterate

2. **Service boundaries wrong**
   - Mitigation: Follow Epic 2 original design, code review
   - Detection: Team discussion, complexity metrics
   - Response: Adjust and re-extract if needed

### Monitoring

- Run full test suite after each story
- Check performance benchmarks weekly
- Review code metrics (line counts) daily
- Track velocity (story points/week)

---

## Communication Plan

### Daily Standup
- Each developer: Yesterday, Today, Blockers
- Review blocked stories
- Adjust assignments if needed

### Weekly Review
- Stories completed
- Metrics updated
- Risks encountered
- Adjustments needed

### End-of-Epic Demo
- Show before/after metrics
- Demonstrate refactored architecture
- Run integration tests live
- Walk through new service structure
