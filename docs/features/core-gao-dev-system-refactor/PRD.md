# Product Requirements Document: Core GAO-Dev System Refactoring

**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Author**: GAO-Dev Team
**Status**: Draft
**Complexity Level**: Level 3 (Large Project)
**Estimated Duration**: 10 weeks

---

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for a comprehensive architectural refactoring of the GAO-Dev core system. The refactoring will transform the current monolithic implementation into a scalable, maintainable, and extensible architecture that follows SOLID principles, implements industry-standard design patterns, and establishes the foundation for GAO-Dev's evolution into a generic agent-factory framework.

**Key Objectives**:
- Eliminate SOLID principle violations (particularly God Classes)
- Implement missing design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Repository, Observer)
- Establish plugin architecture for agents and workflows
- Decouple from BMAD Method specifics to support multiple methodologies
- Enable multi-tenancy and concurrent orchestrator execution
- Achieve 80%+ test coverage with comprehensive unit tests

**Success Criteria**: No class exceeds 300 lines, new agents/workflows can be added via plugins without modifying core, and the system supports multiple concurrent orchestrators.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State

The GAO-Dev core system, while functional, exhibits significant architectural problems that limit its scalability, maintainability, and extensibility:

1. **God Classes**:
   - `GAODevOrchestrator` (1,328 lines) has 10+ responsibilities
   - `SandboxManager` (782 lines) has 8+ responsibilities

2. **SOLID Violations**:
   - Single Responsibility: Most classes violate SRP
   - Open/Closed: Hard-coded if/else chains prevent extension
   - Liskov Substitution: No agent hierarchy or polymorphism
   - Interface Segregation: Missing focused interfaces
   - Dependency Inversion: Direct instantiation everywhere

3. **Missing Design Patterns**:
   - No Factory pattern for agent creation
   - No Strategy pattern for workflow selection
   - No Repository pattern for data access
   - No Observer pattern for event handling

4. **DRY Violations**:
   - Duplicate agent definitions
   - Duplicate serialization code
   - Duplicate path resolution logic

5. **Scalability Blockers**:
   - Hard-coded agent types (8 agents)
   - Hard-coded workflow types
   - Tight coupling to BMAD Method
   - No multi-tenancy support
   - No extension points or plugin system

### Impact

These issues create significant problems:

- **Development Friction**: Simple changes require modifying core classes
- **Testing Difficulty**: Tight coupling makes unit testing nearly impossible
- **Limited Extensibility**: Can't add new agents/workflows without code changes
- **Knowledge Silos**: Large classes are hard to understand and maintain
- **Technical Debt**: Complexity grows exponentially with each feature
- **Vision Blocker**: Can't evolve into generic agent-factory framework

### Future Vision Context

GAO-Dev's long-term vision is to become a **generic agent-factory framework** that allows users to:
- Define custom agent types and roles
- Create custom workflows and methodologies
- Plug in domain-specific agents
- Build multi-agent systems for any domain
- Scale to enterprise deployments

The current architecture makes this vision impossible.
