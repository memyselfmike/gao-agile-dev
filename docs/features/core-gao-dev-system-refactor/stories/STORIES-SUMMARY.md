## Story Dependencies

### Dependency Chain

```
Epic 1 (Foundation)
  ↓
Epic 2 (God Class Refactoring)
  ↓
Epic 3 (Design Patterns)
  ↓
Epic 4 (Plugin Architecture)
  ↓
Epic 5 (Methodology Abstraction)
```

### Critical Path

1. Epic 1 Stories 1.1-1.5 (sequential within epic)
2. Epic 2 Stories 2.1-2.4 → 2.5 (orchestrator depends on extractions)
3. Epic 2 Stories 2.6-2.8 → 2.9 (manager depends on extractions)
4. Epic 3 can start after Epic 2 complete
5. Epic 4 can start after Epic 3 complete
6. Epic 5 can start after Epic 3 complete (doesn't need Epic 4)

---

## Implementation Notes

### Best Practices

1. **One story at a time**: Complete each story fully before moving to next
2. **Test first**: Write tests before implementation where possible
3. **Small commits**: Atomic commits per logical unit
4. **Code review**: All code reviewed before merge
5. **Documentation**: Update docs as you go (not after)

### Quality Gates

**After each story**:
- Tests pass (100%)
- Coverage maintained (80%+)
- Type checks pass (mypy strict)
- Linting passes (ruff)
- Documentation updated

**After each epic**:
- All epic acceptance criteria met
- Integration tests pass
