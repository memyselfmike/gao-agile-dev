# Core GAO-Dev System Refactoring - Documentation

**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Complexity**: Level 3 (Large Project)
**Timeline**: 10 weeks + 2 week buffer
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)

---

## Overview

Complete documentation for the architectural refactoring of the GAO-Dev core system. This refactoring transforms the current monolithic implementation into a scalable, maintainable, plugin-based architecture following SOLID principles.

**Why This Matters**: The current architecture has critical limitations (God Classes, SOLID violations, no extensibility) that block GAO-Dev's evolution into a generic agent-factory framework. This refactoring removes those blockers.

## Success Criteria

The refactoring is complete when:

✅ **No class exceeds 300 lines** (currently: orchestrator = 1,328 lines)
✅ **All SOLID principles followed** (currently: ~15 violations)
✅ **4+ design patterns implemented** (currently: 0)
✅ **80%+ test coverage** (currently: unknown)
✅ **Plugin system functional** (currently: none)
✅ **New agents/workflows added via plugins** (currently: hard-coded)
✅ **BMAD methodology is pluggable** (currently: tightly coupled)
✅ **Zero regression in existing functionality** (comprehensive regression tests)
✅ **Multiple orchestrators can run concurrently** (currently: singleton)

GAODevOrchestrator (1,328 lines)
├── 10+ responsibilities mixed together
├── Hard-coded agent types
├── Hard-coded workflow selection (if/else chains)
├── Tight coupling to BMAD
└── Impossible to test

SandboxManager (782 lines)
├── 8+ responsibilities mixed together
├── Business logic + I/O mixed
├── State management + CRUD mixed
└── Hard to extend
```

### After (Target State)

```
[Layered Architecture with Plugins]

Plugin Layer
├── Custom agents (loaded dynamically)
├── Custom workflows (loaded dynamically)

Service Layer
├── WorkflowCoordinator (< 200 lines)
├── StoryLifecycleManager (< 200 lines)
├── QualityGateManager (< 150 lines)
└── EventBus

Domain Layer
├── BaseAgent → PlanningAgent, ImplementationAgent
├── BaseWorkflow
├── IMethodology → BMADMethodology, SimpleMethodology
└── Value Objects (immutable, validated)

Infrastructure Layer
├── Repositories (data access)
├── File system operations
└── External service integrations
```

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Epic 2**: Breaking existing functionality during refactoring
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive regression test suite BEFORE starting
   - **Mitigation**: Feature flags for gradual rollout
   - **Mitigation**: Parallel implementation (keep old code temporarily)

2. **Epic 4**: Security vulnerabilities in plugin system
   - **Mitigation**: Plugin sandboxing with restricted permissions
   - **Mitigation**: External security audit before release
   - **Mitigation**: Plugin validation and code signing

### Medium-Risk Areas

3. **Epic 3**: Performance degradation from indirection layers
   - **Mitigation**: Benchmark suite before/after
   - **Mitigation**: Profiling critical paths
   - **Mitigation**: Optimization passes if needed

4. **Epic 5**: Incomplete BMAD extraction leaves coupling
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough code audit for BMAD references
   - **Mitigation**: Architecture review after extraction
   - **Mitigation**: Alternative methodology proves decoupling
