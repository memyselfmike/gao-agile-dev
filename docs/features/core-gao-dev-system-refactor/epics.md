# Epics: Core GAO-Dev System Refactoring

**Feature**: Core System Refactoring
**Related PRD**: PRD.md
**Related Architecture**: ARCHITECTURE.md
**Total Epics**: 6
**Timeline**: 13 weeks (+ 2 week buffer)

---

## Overview

This document breaks down the core system refactoring into 5 epics, each representing a major architectural milestone. The epics are designed to be implemented sequentially, with each epic building on the foundation of the previous one.

**Epic Dependencies**:
```
Epic 1 (Foundation)                ← COMPLETE
    ↓
Epic 3 (Design Patterns)           ← COMPLETE
    ↓
Epic 4 (Plugin Architecture)       ← COMPLETE
    ↓
Epic 5 (Methodology Abstraction)   ← COMPLETE
    ↓
Epic 6 (Legacy Cleanup & God Class Refactoring)  ← IN PROGRESS
    (Completes Epic 2 which was skipped)
```

**Note**: Epic 2 was originally planned but never implemented. Epic 6 completes that work along with legacy code cleanup.

## Epic 1: Foundation - Core Interfaces and Abstractions

**Timeline**: Week 1-2 (Sprint 1)
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Risk**: Low (additive changes only)
**Story Points**: 21

### Description

Establish the foundational layer of the new architecture by creating core interfaces, base classes, and value objects. This epic focuses on defining contracts and abstractions without breaking existing code.

### Goals

1. Define all core interfaces (IAgent, IWorkflow, IRepository, etc.)
2. Create value objects for domain concepts
3. Establish base classes for agents and workflows
4. Set up testing infrastructure
5. Zero breaking changes to existing functionality

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All interfaces defined with comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] Value objects have 100% test coverage
- [ ] Base classes implemented with lifecycle methods
- [ ] Testing infrastructure (mocks, fixtures) ready
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

### Stories

  - Gradual extraction with tests
  - Keep BMAD as default (backward compatible)
  - Example methodology proves abstraction works

### Acceptance Criteria

1. IMethodology interface defined with all required methods
2. BMADMethodology class contains all BMAD logic
3. Core orchestrator has no "scale_level" or BMAD-specific concepts

## Epic 6: Legacy Cleanup & God Class Refactoring

**Timeline**: Week 11-13 (Sprint 6)
**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Completing Incomplete Work)
**Risk**: Medium (refactoring existing code)
**Story Points**: 47

### Description

**CRITICAL**: Epic 2 (God Class Refactoring) was never implemented. Epic 6 completes that essential work plus removes legacy code that accumulated during development. This epic is required before moving to production.

After implementing Epics 1, 3, 4, and 5, we have excellent foundational architecture (interfaces, plugins, methodology abstraction) but the **old monolithic God Classes are still running everything**. This epic completes the refactoring by:
1. Extracting services from the 1,327-line orchestrator
2. Extracting services from the 781-line sandbox manager
3. Removing `legacy_models.py` and migrating all imports
4. Validating the complete architecture works end-to-end

### Goals

1. Complete original Epic 2: Extract services from God Classes
2. Refactor orchestrator and manager as thin facades
3. Remove all legacy model duplicates
4. Achieve "no class > 300 lines" success criterion
5. Validate complete architecture with integration tests

### Success Criteria

- [ ] `orchestrator.py` reduced from 1,327 to < 200 lines
- [ ] `sandbox/manager.py` reduced from 781 to < 150 lines
- [ ] All 4 orchestrator services extracted and tested
- [ ] All 3 sandbox services extracted and tested
- [ ] `legacy_models.py` deleted
- [ ] All 8 files migrated from legacy imports
- [ ] Zero regressions (all existing tests pass)
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end workflows

### Stories

| Story | Title | Points | Type |
|-------|-------|--------|------|
| 6.1 | Extract WorkflowCoordinator Service | 5 | Refactoring |
| 6.2 | Extract StoryLifecycleManager Service | 5 | Refactoring |
| 6.3 | Extract ProcessExecutor Service | 3 | Refactoring |
| 6.4 | Extract QualityGateManager Service | 3 | Refactoring |
| 6.5 | Refactor GAODevOrchestrator as Thin Facade | 5 | Refactoring |
| 6.6 | Extract Services from SandboxManager | 8 | Refactoring |
| 6.7 | Refactor SandboxManager as Thin Facade | 3 | Refactoring |
| 6.8 | Migrate from Legacy Models | 5 | Refactoring |
| 6.9 | Integration Testing & Validation | 8 | Testing |
| 6.10 | Update Documentation & Architecture | 2 | Documentation |

### Epic Dependencies

**Prerequisites**:
- Epic 1: Foundation (COMPLETE - interfaces exist)
- Epic 3: Design Patterns (COMPLETE - patterns available)
- Epic 4: Plugin Architecture (COMPLETE)
- Epic 5: Methodology Abstraction (COMPLETE)

**Enables**:
- Production readiness (all architecture goals met)
- Clean codebase for future development
- Simplified onboarding for new developers

### Risks

- **Medium Risk**: Refactoring critical classes could introduce bugs
- **Medium Risk**: Service boundaries might be wrong, requiring iteration
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive regression test suite BEFORE starting
  - Extract one service at a time with tests
  - Feature flags for gradual rollout
  - Parallel implementation (keep old code temporarily)
  - Code review after each service extraction
  - Integration tests after each story

### Background: Why Epic 6 is Necessary

During the refactoring sprint (Epics 1-5), the following occurred:

**What Was Completed** ✅:
- Epic 1: Core interfaces, models, base classes
- Epic 3: Design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Repository, Observer)
- Epic 4: Plugin architecture with examples
- Epic 5: Methodology abstraction (BMAD → AdaptiveAgile)

**What Was Skipped** ❌:
- **Epic 2: God Class Refactoring** - The most critical epic was never implemented
- The `core/services/` directory exists but is **EMPTY**
- God Classes remain: orchestrator.py (1,327 lines), manager.py (781 lines)

**The Problem**:
We have beautiful new architecture (interfaces, plugins, patterns) but the old monolithic code is still running everything. This creates:
- Confusion for developers (two parallel systems)
- SOLID violations (God Classes)
- Unmet success criteria (classes > 300 lines)
- Technical debt blocking production

**The Solution**:
Epic 6 completes the work that should have been Epic 2, plus cleans up the legacy code that accumulated.
