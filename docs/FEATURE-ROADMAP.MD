- move to uv not pip as a runner 
- add rich cli interface formatting
- build out and utilise core repos for quickstart/boilerplate e.g. full saas (plans, licensing, customer portal, support, billing) / marketing funnel etc
    - this should be framework driven too -> some method for reusable assets retrieval/creation (if not exists create asset)

- bmad story context creation step missing
- autoscale prompting level (bmad scale level)
    -> chores > bugs > features > brownfield / greenfield < we need to know when the human or agentic product owner need to get involved to guide
    -> we need benchmarking projects for each of these
- always ensure architectural checks before and after features
- add dedicated qa agent/team that works with 
- know when the PO needs to be invoked
- add comliance checks at every step > compliance agent in the loop to constantly check and iterate if sops are being adhered to
- e2e testing in the loop > for any frontend work we need to ensure we utlise playwright to thoroughly test core features in desltop / mobile
- retrospective at end of each epic
- can we use git prs / branches (and worktrees within branches) to instantiate instances of a team with improvement opportunities to imporve the core system as it works on other projects???
- chrome extension developer
- firebase hosting team / migrations<<< should it be a small locally hosted tool or shoudl we set up full firebase project?>>>
- documentation specialist 
    - document lifecycle - we need to properly archive once work is done and reset to keep better track
    - < we need both dev and user docs always updated in realtime - video demos are useful too
- usablity expert <-- tooltips, accessiblity how intuitive is it to use>
- persistant dev memory
- retrospectives
- self improve the core team.. framework not function
- point of contact - brian - entry point agent that can coordinate and orchestrate projects and transform into other personas for agent handoff from other gao depts that need some engineering working done or 
- changelog handling (user facing)
- automatic tech support and bug fixes
- automatic feature adding
- mass email users capability
- gamification standards
- apply budgeting to work e.g. if a new project - what are we investing in this development cycle - do we want to go fully fleshed out high end app or simple mvp and what are we willng to spend 
- utlise much better wireframe / graphical prototyping
- ensure everything is multiple pass at review from different useful persepticves

    D:\GAO Agile Dev\docs\CONTEXT-TRACKING-ROADMAP.md <- gao-wisdom? this ties in with document lifecycle management also>


- immediate bug fixes
    - not doign git commits < lets have a method for pulling a benchmarking branch then committing everything there and making comments along the way to give realt time observability in the remote repo

once this is all sorted...
- better cli
- chat capability
- gao-forge agent factory and academy
