# GAO-Dev Benchmarking Philosophy

## The Right Way to Benchmark GAO-Dev

### The Core Question

**What are we actually trying to test?**

We're not testing whether agents can execute isolated tasks in a sandbox. We're testing whether **GAO-Dev as a system** can take Product Owner prompts and autonomously deliver production-ready applications.

### The Problem with Traditional Benchmarks

Traditional benchmarks test the **wrong thing**:

```yaml
# ❌ WRONG: Task-based benchmark
phases:
  - name: "Implementation"
    tasks:
      - "Implement Task model"
      - "Implement API endpoints"
      - "Create React components"
```

**Problems**:
- Predefined task lists (not autonomous)
- No orchestration testing (just execution)
- Doesn't test agent coordination
- Doesn't test BMAD Method workflows
- Not how a Product Owner would actually use GAO-Dev

### The Right Approach: Orchestration-Based Benchmarks

Test GAO-Dev the way it's **meant to be used**:

```yaml
# ✅ RIGHT: Orchestration-based benchmark
interaction_sequence:
  - name: "Initial Product Vision"
    actor: "Product Owner"
    command: "gao-dev create-prd --name 'Todo Application'"
    prompt: |
      I want to build a todo application with...
      [Natural Product Owner prompt]
    expected_agent: "John (Product Manager)"
```

**Benefits**:
- Tests real Product Owner → GAO-Dev interaction
- Tests agent orchestration and handoffs
- Tests BMAD Method workflows
- Repeatable, systematic prompts
- Measures actual GAO-Dev capabilities

---

## Three Generations of Benchmarks

### Generation 1: Phase-Based (Waterfall)

**Example**: `todo-app.yaml`

**Characteristics**:
- Waterfall phases: planning → architecture → implementation → testing
- Each phase is isolated
- No story-level granularity
- Generic agent execution

**Use Case**: Testing basic workflow flow, not realistic

**Limitations**:
- Doesn't test agile/incremental workflow
- Doesn't test story-level autonomy
- Doesn't match how GAO-Dev should work

### Generation 2: Story-Based (Incremental)

**Example**: `todo-app-incremental.yaml`

**Characteristics**:
- Epic/story breakdown with dependencies
- Story-by-story execution
- Each story has acceptance criteria
- Tests incremental development

**Use Case**: Testing story execution, better than Gen 1

**Limitations**:
- Still predefined task lists
- Doesn't test GAO-Dev orchestration
- Doesn't test Product Owner interaction
- Stories are pre-written (not created autonomously)

### Generation 3: Orchestration-Based (Greenfield)

**Example**: `greenfield-todo-app.yaml` ⭐ **THIS IS THE WAY**

**Characteristics**:
- Product Owner interaction model
- Systematic, repeatable prompts
- Tests GAO-Dev orchestration (`create-prd`, `create-story`, `implement-story`)
- Tests agent coordination and handoffs
- Tests BMAD Method workflows
- Greenfield (starts from scratch)
- Autonomous story creation (not predefined)

**Use Case**: **Testing GAO-Dev as a product** - the right way

**Benefits**:
- Tests the actual system we're building
- Repeatable benchmarks show improvement over time
- Realistic Product Owner usage patterns
- Measures full autonomous capabilities
- Validates the entire BMAD Method

## Benchmarking Philosophy

### What We're Really Testing

When we benchmark GAO-Dev, we're testing:

1. **Autonomous Orchestration**: Can GAO-Dev coordinate agents without manual intervention?
2. **Agent Handoffs**: Do agents hand off work correctly (Mary → John → Winston → Bob → Amelia → Murat)?
3. **BMAD Method**: Do the workflows produce quality outputs?
4. **Product Owner UX**: Is the interaction model intuitive and effective?
5. **Quality**: Does the output meet production standards?
6. **Completeness**: Does GAO-Dev deliver working applications, not just foundations?

### Success Criteria

A successful benchmark means:

✅ **Product Owner gives natural prompts** (not technical instructions)
✅ **GAO-Dev autonomously orchestrates agents** (no manual intervention)
✅ **Each agent does their specialized work** (Mary researches, John plans, Amelia codes, etc.)
✅ **Handoffs are smooth** (agents pass context correctly)
✅ **Output is production-ready** (working app, tests passing, documented)
✅ **Process is repeatable** (same prompts → similar results)

### Failure Modes to Detect

Benchmarks should catch these failures:

❌ **Manual intervention required** (autonomy failure)
❌ **Agent stops prematurely** (doesn't complete work)
❌ **Poor handoffs** (next agent lacks context)
❌ **Low quality output** (tests fail, linting errors, etc.)
❌ **Incomplete features** (only foundation, not full implementation)
❌ **Process not repeatable** (different results each run)

---

## Benchmark Design Principles

### 1. Test the System, Not the Tasks

**Wrong**:
```yaml
tasks:
  - "Implement user authentication"
  - "Create database schema"
```

**Right**:
```yaml
prompt: |
  I want to build an application with user authentication.
  Please create the necessary documentation and implement it.
command: "gao-dev create-prd --name 'My App'"
```

### 2. Mimic Real Usage

**Wrong**: Predefined technical task lists

**Right**: Natural Product Owner prompts that real POs would give

### 3. Measure What Matters

**Don't just measure**:
- Task completion count
- Lines of code generated

**Do measure**:
- Manual interventions required
- Agent handoff success rate
- Quality metrics (tests, coverage, linting)
- Functional completeness
- Time to working application
- Token/cost efficiency

### 4. Start from Greenfield

**Wrong**: Clone boilerplate with predefined structure

**Right**: Start from empty directory, let GAO-Dev structure the project

**Why**: Tests whether GAO-Dev can make architectural decisions, not just fill in templates

### 5. Make It Repeatable

**Wrong**: Ad-hoc manual testing

**Right**: YAML configs with systematic prompts that can run anytime

**Why**: Track improvement over time, detect regressions, compare approaches

## The Greenfield Benchmark Structure

### Interaction Sequence

The core of an orchestration benchmark is the **interaction sequence** - a series of Product Owner prompts:

```yaml
interaction_sequence:
  - name: "Phase 1: Product Vision"
    actor: "Product Owner"
    command: "gao-dev create-prd ..."
    prompt: "I want to build..."
    expected_agent: "John (PM)"
    expected_artifacts: ["docs/PRD.md"]

  - name: "Phase 2: Technical Design"
    actor: "Product Owner"
    command: "gao-dev create-architecture ..."
    prompt: "Please design the architecture..."
    expected_agent: "Winston (Architect)"
    expected_artifacts: ["docs/ARCHITECTURE.md"]

  - name: "Phase 3: Story Creation"
    actor: "Product Owner"
    command: "gao-dev create-stories ..."
    prompt: "Break this into implementable stories..."
    expected_agent: "Bob (Scrum Master)"
    expected_artifacts: ["docs/stories/**/*.md"]

  - name: "Phase 4: Implementation"
    actor: "Product Owner"
    command: "gao-dev implement-all-stories"
    prompt: "Implement all stories with tests..."
    expected_agent: "Amelia (Developer) + Bob"
    expected_artifacts: ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*"]

  - name: "Phase 5: Quality Check"
    actor: "Product Owner"
    command: "gao-dev run-qa ..."
    prompt: "Run comprehensive QA..."
    expected_agent: "Murat (QA)"
    expected_artifacts: ["docs/QA_REPORT.md"]
```

### Key Elements

1. **Actor**: Who is giving the prompt (always "Product Owner" for greenfield)
2. **Command**: The `gao-dev` CLI command to execute
3. **Prompt**: The natural language prompt the PO gives
4. **Expected Agent**: Which GAO-Dev agent should handle this
5. **Expected Artifacts**: What files should be created
6. **Success Criteria**: How to validate this phase succeeded
7. **Dependencies**: Which phases must complete first

### Success Criteria Layers

**Per-Interaction**:
- Artifacts created
- Agent completed without errors
- Quality gates passed

**Overall Benchmark**:
- All interactions completed
- Application is functional
- Tests passing (>80% coverage)
- No linting/type errors
- Documentation complete
- Production-ready

---

## Comparison: Old vs New Approach

### Old Approach (Phase-Based)

```yaml
workflow_phases:
  - phase_name: implementation
    timeout_seconds: 3600
    expected_artifacts:
      - src/
      - tests/
```

**What this tests**: Can we execute a generic "implementation" phase?

**What this doesn't test**:
- How GAO-Dev orchestrates agents
- How agents create planning docs
- How stories are broken down
- How agents hand off work
- Real Product Owner interaction

### New Approach (Orchestration-Based)

```yaml
interaction_sequence:
  - name: "Create PRD"
    command: "gao-dev create-prd --name 'Todo App'"
    prompt: "I want to build a todo app with..."
    expected_agent: "John"

  - name: "Create Architecture"
    command: "gao-dev create-architecture --name 'Todo App'"
    prompt: "Design the system architecture..."
    expected_agent: "Winston"

  - name: "Implement Stories"
    command: "gao-dev implement-all-stories"
    prompt: "Implement all stories with tests..."
    expected_agent: "Amelia + Bob"
```

**What this tests**: Everything that matters!
- Real GAO-Dev commands
- Product Owner UX
- Agent orchestration
- BMAD Method workflows
- End-to-end autonomous delivery

## How to Use Greenfield Benchmarks

### Step 1: Define Your Product Owner Prompts

Think about how a real Product Owner would interact with GAO-Dev:

```yaml
interaction_sequence:
  - name: "Initial Vision"
    prompt: |
      I want to build a [type of application].

      Core features:
      - [Feature 1]
      - [Feature 2]

      Technical requirements:
      - [Requirement 1]
      - [Requirement 2]

      Quality standards:
      - [Standard 1]
      - [Standard 2]
```

### Step 2: Map to GAO-Dev Commands

For each prompt, specify which `gao-dev` command to use:

- `gao-dev create-prd` - Create Product Requirements Document
- `gao-dev create-architecture` - Create system architecture
- `gao-dev create-stories` - Break into user stories
- `gao-dev implement-story` - Implement specific story
- `gao-dev implement-all-stories` - Implement all stories
- `gao-dev run-qa` - Run quality assurance

### Step 3: Define Success Criteria

What does success look like?

**Functional**:
- Application runs without errors
- All features work as specified
- User flows are complete

**Quality**:
- Tests passing (>80% coverage)
- No linting errors
- No type errors
- Security audit clean

**Process**:
- All artifacts created
- Atomic git commits
- Documentation complete
- BMAD Method followed

### Step 4: Run and Measure

Execute the benchmark and collect metrics:

```bash
gao-dev /run-benchmark greenfield-todo-app
```

**Metrics to track**:
- **Autonomy**: Manual interventions required, error recovery rate
- **Quality**: Test coverage, linting, type safety, security
- **Performance**: Time to completion, token usage, cost
- **Completeness**: Acceptance criteria met, features working

### Step 5: Iterate and Improve

Use benchmarks to drive improvement:

1. **Baseline**: First run establishes baseline metrics
2. **Identify Gaps**: Where did autonomy fail? Quality issues?
3. **Improve System**: Fix agent prompts, workflows, tools
4. **Re-run**: Measure improvement
5. **Track Trends**: Are we getting better over time?

## Benchmark Naming Convention

Use meaningful names that describe what you're testing:

**Good Names**:
- `greenfield-todo-app.yaml` - Build todo app from scratch
- `greenfield-blog-platform.yaml` - Build blog from scratch
- `greenfield-api-service.yaml` - Build API service from scratch

**Bad Names**:
- `benchmark1.yaml` - Not descriptive
- `test.yaml` - Too generic
- `todo-app.yaml` - Doesn't indicate it's greenfield/orchestration

---

## Cost-Benefit of Greenfield Benchmarks

### Costs

**Setup Time**: Takes longer to design good interaction sequences
**Execution Time**: Greenfield takes longer than boilerplate (more decisions)
**Token Cost**: More tokens for planning phases

### Benefits

**Real Testing**: Tests what actually matters - the orchestration system
**Repeatability**: Can run same benchmark repeatedly to measure improvement
**Feedback Loop**: Clear metrics show where system needs improvement
**Confidence**: Validates GAO-Dev can actually deliver end-to-end
**Documentation**: Interaction sequences serve as usage examples

**The ROI**: Worth every penny to test the right thing!

## Future: Multi-Project Benchmarks

Once greenfield todo app works well, expand to:

### Complexity Tiers

1. **Simple** (20-30 stories): Todo app, Notes app, Timer app
2. **Medium** (50-80 stories): Blog platform, Chat app, Kanban board
3. **Complex** (100+ stories): E-commerce, Social network, SaaS platform

### Technology Stacks

- **Frontend**: React, Vue, Svelte
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, Go, Rust
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, Vercel, AWS

### Quality Levels

- **MVP**: Basic features, 60% coverage, some manual steps OK
- **Production**: All features, 80% coverage, fully autonomous
- **Enterprise**: Advanced features, 90% coverage, security audit, performance tuned

## Key Takeaways

1. **Test the System**: Benchmark GAO-Dev orchestration, not isolated tasks
2. **Mimic Reality**: Use Product Owner prompts, not technical instructions
3. **Start Greenfield**: Let GAO-Dev make decisions, don't pre-structure
4. **Measure What Matters**: Autonomy, quality, completeness, not just lines of code
5. **Iterate**: Use metrics to improve system over time
6. **Be Systematic**: Repeatable prompts enable tracking improvement

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review**: Read `greenfield-todo-app.yaml` to see the structure
2. **Run**: Execute your first greenfield benchmark
3. **Analyze**: Review metrics and identify gaps
4. **Improve**: Refine agent prompts, workflows, or tools
5. **Repeat**: Re-run to validate improvements
6. **Expand**: Create benchmarks for other project types

---

**Remember**: The goal isn't just to build a todo app. The goal is to **prove GAO-Dev can autonomously build ANY app from a Product Owner prompt.**

Greenfield orchestration benchmarks are how we get there.
