# BMM Workflow Status

## Current State

**Phase**: 4 - Implementation
**Scale Level**: 3 (Level 3: 12-40 stories, 2-5 epics - we have 6 epics)
**Project Type**: Software - Python Development Framework
**Current Epic**: Epic 3 - Metrics Collection System
**Status**: Epic 3 Complete - 3 epics done, ready for Epic 4

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a deterministic sandbox environment and comprehensive benchmarking system that enables GAO-Dev to validate its autonomous capabilities, measure performance improvements over time, and produce production-ready applications from simple prompts.

**Key Documents**:
- PRD: `docs/features/sandbox-system/PRD.md`
- Architecture: `docs/features/sandbox-system/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Epics: `docs/features/sandbox-system/epics.md`

## Phase History

## Current Epic: Epic 3 - Metrics Collection System (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: Build comprehensive metrics collection system that tracks performance, autonomy, quality, and workflow metrics during benchmark runs.

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ All metric categories collected (performance, autonomy, quality, workflow)
- ‚úÖ < 5% performance overhead
- ‚úÖ Metrics persisted to database
- ‚úÖ Can query historical data
- ‚úÖ Export to CSV/JSON
