## Epic 8: Reference Todo Application - CANCELLED

**Status**: ‚ùå CANCELLED (2025-10-29)

**Original Plan**: Manually create a comprehensive reference todo application as a benchmark target with detailed specifications, tests, and documentation.

**Why Cancelled**: Architectural paradigm shift in Epic 7.2 makes this obsolete.

**The Shift**:
- **Before Epic 7.2**: We create reference apps manually ‚Üí Use as benchmarks ‚Üí GAO-Dev tries to match
- **After Epic 7.2**: We give GAO-Dev a prompt ‚Üí GAO-Dev autonomously BUILDS the app ‚Üí We validate

**The Problem with Epic 8**:
Creating a reference todo app manually contradicts GAO-Dev's core value proposition: **"Simple prompt ‚Üí Production-ready app"**

If we manually build the reference app, we're not testing GAO-Dev's autonomous capabilities. We're just testing if it can copy something we already built.

**The Solution**:
Instead of Epic 8, we created `sandbox/benchmarks/workflow-driven-todo.yaml`:
- Provides initial_prompt: "Build a todo application..."
- Brian selects appropriate workflows
- GAO-Dev autonomously creates ALL artifacts
- System proves itself by BUILDING the app

This tests the ACTUAL autonomous development capability, not just comparison to a manual reference.

**Replacement**: `sandbox/benchmarks/workflow-driven-todo.yaml` - Let GAO-Dev BUILD it!

## Next Actions

1. **RUN WORKFLOW-DRIVEN BENCHMARKS** - Test GAO-Dev's autonomous capabilities
   - Use: `sandbox/benchmarks/workflow-driven-todo.yaml`
   - Requires: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   - Command: `gao-dev sandbox run sandbox/benchmarks/workflow-driven-todo.yaml`
   - Expected: Complete todo app autonomously created

2. **TEST AT DIFFERENT SCALE LEVELS**
   - Level 0: Chore (fix typo, update docs)
   - Level 1: Bug fix (single file change)
   - Level 2: Small feature (3-8 stories) ‚Üê tested with todo app
   - Level 3: Medium feature (12-20 stories)
   - Level 4: Greenfield application (40+ stories)

3. **OPTIONAL: Story 4.8** - Implement Standalone Execution Mode (requires anthropic SDK)

4. **EPIC 9: Continuous Improvement** - Based on real benchmark results
   - Create stories for gaps identified
   - Optimize workflow selection
   - Improve agent prompts
   - Enhance error handling

5. **Continue BMAD Process** - Follow implementation workflows
