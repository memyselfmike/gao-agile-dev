**Achievement**:
Epic 6 enables true agile development: create ONE story ‚Üí implement ‚Üí test ‚Üí commit ‚Üí repeat. This mirrors how GAO-Dev itself is being built using BMAD Method.

## Current Epic: Epic 7 - Autonomous Artifact Creation & Git Integration (READY)

**Goal**: Make benchmarks use GAO-Dev's existing orchestration to create real, visible project artifacts with atomic git commits.

**Success Criteria**:
1. Benchmark runs execute GAO-Dev commands (not AgentSpawner)
2. All agent outputs persisted to appropriate files
3. Atomic git commits after each phase/story
4. Full project artifacts visible in sandbox/projects/
5. Metrics still collected (tokens, cost, duration)
6. Can see complete project history in git log

**Stories to Complete**:
1. ‚è≥ Story 7.1: Remove AgentSpawner & Refactor to GAODevOrchestrator (5 points)
2. ‚è≥ Story 7.2: Implement Artifact Output Parser (3 points)
3. ‚è≥ Story 7.3: Implement Atomic Git Commits (3 points)
4. ‚è≥ Story 7.4: Update Metrics Collection (2 points)
5. ‚è≥ Story 7.5: Add Artifact Verification (3 points)
6. ‚è≥ Story 7.6: Create Example Benchmark with Artifacts (2 points)
7. ‚è≥ Story 7.7: Update Documentation (3 points)

**Total**: 21 story points, 7 stories

**Why This is Critical**:
This is THE core functionality of GAO-Dev. Without artifact creation and git integration, GAO-Dev is just a chatbot. This epic makes it a real autonomous development system.

As the EPIC-7-PLAN.md states: "The whole point of GAO-Dev is to autonomously build real projects with visible artifacts and atomic commits."

## Next Actions

1. **Start Epic 7** - Begin with Story 7.1 (Remove AgentSpawner & Refactor to GAODevOrchestrator)
2. **Complete Epic 7** - Critical for making GAO-Dev actually create artifacts
3. **Optional: Story 4.8** - Implement Standalone Execution Mode (requires anthropic SDK)
4. **Then Epic 8** - Reference Todo Application benchmark
5. **Continue BMAD Process** - Follow implementation workflows
