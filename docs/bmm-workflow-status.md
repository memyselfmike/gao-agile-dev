# BMM Workflow Status

## Current State

**Phase**: 4 - Implementation
**Scale Level**: 3 (Level 3: 12-40 stories, 2-5 epics - we have 6 epics)
**Project Type**: Software - Python Development Framework
**Current Epic**: Epic 4 - Benchmark Runner
**Status**: Epic 4 Nearly Complete - 7 of 8 stories done (88% done)

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a deterministic sandbox environment and comprehensive benchmarking system that enables GAO-Dev to validate its autonomous capabilities, measure performance improvements over time, and produce production-ready applications from simple prompts.

**Key Documents**:
- PRD: `docs/features/sandbox-system/PRD.md`
- Architecture: `docs/features/sandbox-system/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Epics: `docs/features/sandbox-system/epics.md`

## Phase History

### Phase 1: Analysis ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Product vision established
- Requirements gathered
- System designed

### Phase 2: Planning ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- PRD created with comprehensive requirements
- 6 Epics defined with detailed breakdown
- Success criteria established
- Technical approach validated

### Phase 3: Solutioning ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**Epic 5: Reporting & Visualization** ‚è≥ PENDING
- Depends on: Epic 3, Epic 4

**Epic 6: Reference Todo App** ‚è≥ PENDING
- Can be done in parallel

**Epic 7: Iterative Improvement** ‚è≥ PENDING
- Starts after Epic 4 is working

## Previous Epic: Epic 3 - Metrics Collection System (COMPLETE)

**Goal**: Build comprehensive metrics collection system that tracks performance, autonomy, quality, and workflow metrics during benchmark runs.

**Success Criteria**: All achieved ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ All metric categories collected (performance, autonomy, quality, workflow)
- ‚úÖ < 5% performance overhead
- ‚úÖ Metrics persisted to database
- ‚úÖ Can query historical data
- ‚úÖ Export to CSV/JSON

**Total**: 231 tests, 93%+ coverage, all 9 stories completed

## Current Epic: Epic 4 - Benchmark Runner (IN PROGRESS)

**Goal**: Build automated benchmark execution system that orchestrates complete development workflows and validates results against success criteria.

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ YAML/JSON config schema for benchmarks
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive config validation
- ‚úÖ Orchestrates sandbox + boilerplate + workflow execution
- ‚úÖ Multi-phase workflow orchestration
- ‚úÖ Validates results against success criteria
- ‚úÖ Real-time progress tracking
- ‚úÖ Advanced timeout management
- ‚è≥ Standalone execution mode (deferred - requires anthropic SDK)

**Completed Stories**:
1. ‚úÖ Story 4.1: Benchmark Config Schema (30 tests, 99% coverage)
2. ‚úÖ Story 4.2: Config Validation (30 tests, 100% coverage)
3. ‚úÖ Story 4.3: Benchmark Runner Core (16 tests, 98% coverage)
4. ‚úÖ Story 4.4: Workflow Orchestration (8 tests, 77% coverage)
5. ‚úÖ Story 4.5: Progress Tracking (27 tests, 87% coverage)
6. ‚úÖ Story 4.6: Timeout Management (28 tests, 96% coverage)
7. ‚úÖ Story 4.7: Success Criteria Checker (28 tests, 100% coverage)

**Deferred Story**:
8. ‚è≥ Story 4.8: Standalone Execution Mode (4 story points) - READY (requires anthropic SDK)

**Total So Far**: 167 benchmark tests passing, 7 of 8 stories complete (88%)

## Next Actions

1. **Optional: Story 4.8** - Implement Standalone Execution Mode (requires anthropic SDK)
2. **Merge Epic 4 Branch** - Merge `feature/epic-4-benchmark-runner` to main
3. **Begin Epic 5** - Start Reporting & Visualization
4. **Continue BMAD Process** - Follow implementation workflows
