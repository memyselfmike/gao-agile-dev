# BMM Workflow Status

## Current State

**Phase**: 4 - Implementation
**Scale Level**: 3 (Level 3: 12-40 stories, 2-5 epics - we have 6 epics)
**Project Type**: Software - Python Development Framework
**Current Epic**: Epic 2 - Boilerplate Integration
**Status**: Ready to begin Epic 2 story creation

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Build a deterministic sandbox environment and comprehensive benchmarking system that enables GAO-Dev to validate its autonomous capabilities, measure performance improvements over time, and produce production-ready applications from simple prompts.

**Key Documents**:
- PRD: `docs/features/sandbox-system/PRD.md`
- Architecture: `docs/features/sandbox-system/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Epics: `docs/features/sandbox-system/epics.md`

## Phase History

### Phase 1: Analysis ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Product vision established
- Requirements gathered
- System designed

### Phase 2: Planning ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- PRD created with comprehensive requirements
- 6 Epics defined with detailed breakdown
- Success criteria established
- Technical approach validated

### Phase 3: Solutioning ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- System architecture designed
- Component interfaces defined
- Technology stack selected (Python, SQLite, Click CLI)

### Phase 4: Implementation üîÑ IN PROGRESS

**Epic 1: Sandbox Infrastructure** ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Stories 1.1-1.6)
- Sandbox CLI command structure
- Sandbox Manager implementation
- Project state management
- init, clean, list, run commands
- All tests passing

**Epic 2: Boilerplate Integration** üìã NEXT (Stories 2.1-2.5)
- Status: Ready for story creation
- Owner: Amelia (Developer)
- Duration: 1 week
- Stories needed: 5 stories to be created

**Epic 3: Metrics Collection** ‚è≥ PENDING
- Depends on: Epic 1 ‚úÖ

**Epic 4: Benchmark Runner** ‚è≥ PENDING
- Depends on: Epic 1 ‚úÖ, Epic 2, Epic 3

**Epic 5: Reporting & Visualization** ‚è≥ PENDING
- Depends on: Epic 3, Epic 4

**Epic 6: Reference Todo App** ‚è≥ PENDING
- Can be done in parallel

**Epic 7: Iterative Improvement** ‚è≥ PENDING
- Starts after Epic 4 is working

## Current Epic: Epic 2 - Boilerplate Integration

**Goal**: Implement automated cloning and configuration of boilerplate repositories, including template variable substitution and dependency installation.

**Success Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ Can clone Git repositories
- ‚úÖ Template variables correctly substituted
- ‚úÖ Dependencies auto-installed
- ‚úÖ Works with provided Next.js starter
- ‚úÖ Handles errors gracefully

**Stories to Create** (from epics.md):
1. Story 2.1: Git Repository Cloning
2. Story 2.2: Template Variable Detection
3. Story 2.3: Variable Substitution Engine
4. Story 2.4: Dependency Installation
5. Story 2.5: Boilerplate Validation

## Next Actions

1. **Create Epic 2 Stories** - Use BMAD `create-story` workflow for each story
2. **Begin Implementation** - Start with Story 2.1 using `dev-story` workflow
3. **Follow BMAD Process** - Use proper story-context and dev-story workflows

## Update History

- **2025-10-27**: BMAD Method installed and configured
- **2025-10-27**: Workflow status initialized at Epic 2
- **2025-10-27**: Epic 1 marked complete (all 6 stories done)
