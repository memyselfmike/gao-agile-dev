# GAO-Dev Iteration Log

**Purpose**: Track benchmark runs, learnings, and improvements over time
**Owner**: Full Team
**Started**: 2025-10-27

---

## Overview

This log captures the results of each sandbox benchmark run, documenting what we learned and how GAO-Dev improved iteration over iteration.

**Goal**: Achieve 95%+ autonomous completion with zero manual interventions

---

## Iteration Summary

| Run | Date | Benchmark | Autonomy | Quality | Time | Cost | Status |
|-----|------|-----------|----------|---------|------|------|--------|
| 001 | TBD  | Manual test | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Pending |
| 002 | TBD  | Todo baseline | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | Pending |

---

## Run 001 - [Date TBD]

### Goal
First manual benchmark to establish baseline and identify gaps

### Configuration
- **Project**: Simple test project (not full todo app)
- **Benchmark**: Manual execution with metric collection
- **Mode**: Manual intervention allowed
- **Focus**: Identify pain points and gaps

### Approach
1. Use sandbox to create small project
2. Manually track interventions needed
3. Note errors and blockers
4. Document time and token usage

### Results

#### Metrics
| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Manual interventions | <10 | TBD | - |
| Task completion rate | >50% | TBD | - |
| Total time | <2h | TBD | - |
| Agent handoffs | N/A | TBD | - |

- [ ] Update agent prompts based on learnings

---

## Run 002 - [Date TBD]

### Goal
Test improvements from Run 001 and move toward semi-autonomous

### Configuration
- **Project**: Todo app baseline
- **Benchmark**: `benchmarks/todo-baseline-v1.yaml`
- **Mode**: Semi-autonomous (minimal intervention)
- **Focus**: Validate improvements, measure progress

### Approach
1. Implement top 3-5 improvements from Run 001
2. Run todo app benchmark
3. Compare metrics to baseline
4. Identify remaining gaps
