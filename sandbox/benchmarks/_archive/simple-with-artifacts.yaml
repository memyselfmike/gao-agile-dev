# Simple Benchmark with Artifacts - Epic 7 Example
#
# This benchmark demonstrates GAO-Dev's artifact creation capabilities
# introduced in Epic 7. It creates real files with atomic git commits.
#
# What to expect:
# - PRD document in docs/PRD.md
# - Architecture document in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
# - User stories in docs/stories/
# - Implementation files in src/
# - Git commits after each phase
