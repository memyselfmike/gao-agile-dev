## 📋 Project Overview

### The Goal
Create a deterministic sandbox environment that allows us to:
- Test GAO-Dev's autonomous capabilities end-to-end
- Measure performance, quality, and autonomy metrics
- Track improvement over iterations
- Validate that simple prompt → production-ready app works

### The Approach
Build a full-stack todo application as the reference benchmark:
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (from your boilerplate)
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes (MVP) or FastAPI (future)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Deployment**: Docker

gao-dev sandbox status <run-id>

# Reporting
gao-dev sandbox report <run-id>
gao-dev sandbox compare <run1> <run2>
gao-dev sandbox trends --last <n>
gao-dev sandbox export <run-id> --format csv
```

## 📊 Metrics Tracked

### Performance
- Total time (start → finish)
- Time per phase (Analysis, Planning, Solutioning, Implementation)
- Token usage (total + per agent)
- API calls and cost

### Autonomy
- Manual interventions required
- Prompts needed (initial + follow-ups)
- One-shot success rate
- Error recovery rate
- Agent handoffs (successful vs. failed)

### Quality

## 🔑 Key Technical Decisions

### Boilerplate
- ✅ **Frontend**: https://github.com/webventurer/simple-nextjs-starter
- ✅ **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, SCSS, Biome, pnpm
- ✅ **Backend Strategy**: Start with Next.js API routes, optionally migrate to FastAPI later

### Architecture
- ✅ **Metrics Storage**: SQLite (simple, portable, no setup)
- ✅ **Templating**: Jinja2 for HTML reports
- ✅ **Execution**: Standalone mode with API key (solves Claude Code nesting issue)
- ✅ **Charts**: Matplotlib or Chart.js
- ✅ **Config Format**: YAML for benchmark configs

### Implementation
- ✅ **Location**: `gao_dev/sandbox/` module
- ✅ **CLI**: Extend existing Click-based CLI
- ✅ **Testing**: Unit tests for all components (80%+ coverage)
- ✅ **Code Style**: Match existing GAO-Dev (ASCII-only, type hints, docstrings)

---

## 🚧 Critical Discovery: Agent Spawning Limitation

### The Problem
- Cannot spawn GAO-Dev agents (like `gao-dev create-prd`) from within Claude Code session
- SDK tries to nest Claude sessions, which hangs

### The Solution
**Standalone Execution Mode** (Epic 4, Story 4.8):
```bash
# Run benchmark outside Claude Code with API key
python -m gao_dev.sandbox.runner \
    --project todo-app \
    --benchmark benchmarks/todo-baseline.yaml \
    --api-key $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

This enables:
- ✅ True autonomous execution
- ✅ Proper agent spawning
- ✅ Automated benchmarking
- ✅ CI/CD integration (future)

### Workaround for Development
Use hybrid mode during development:
1. Generate execution plan
2. User executes steps manually in Claude Code
3. Collect metrics manually

Then switch to standalone mode for final benchmarks.

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Option A: Start Implementation
Begin implementing Story 1.1 (Sandbox CLI structure):

1. Create `gao_dev/cli/sandbox_commands.py`
2. Define all 6 sandbox subcommands
3. Register in main CLI
4. Test help output and error handling
5. Commit and move to Story 1.2

### Option B: Complete Planning
Create remaining stories for Epic 1:

1. Story 1.2: Sandbox Manager Implementation
2. Story 1.3: Project State Management
3. Story 1.4: Sandbox init Command
4. Story 1.5: Sandbox clean Command
5. Story 1.6: Sandbox list Command

Then start implementation.

### Option C: Get More Input
Ask questions about:
1. Backend preference (Next.js API routes vs. FastAPI)
2. Scope preference (MVP vs. full features)
3. Timeline constraints
4. API key availability for standalone mode

## 💡 What We Validated

### The BMAD Methodology Works!
We successfully used GAO-Dev's own process to plan GAO-Dev improvements:
- ✅ Created PROJECT_BRIEF (Mary's role)
- ✅ Created PRD (John's role)
- ✅ Created ARCHITECTURE (Winston's role)
- ✅ Created EPICS (John/Bob's roles)
- ✅ Created STORIES (Bob's role)

Next: Use Amelia to implement!

### Eating Our Own Dog Food
The sandbox system will enable us to:
- Validate that the BMAD process produces production-ready code
- Measure improvement as we refine agents and workflows
- Prove that "simple prompt → working app" is achievable
- Build confidence in GAO-Dev's autonomous capabilities
